/// other HookInfo references within the list). We update the shared information within the HookInfo and perform the
/// install as necessary. Priorities use named IDs for cleaer ordering (before x, after y). This may require a full

/// 1. If it is the only hook, destroys the fixups, uninstalls the hook by replacing the original instructions. Note
/// that this also destroys leapfrog hooks.
/// 2. If this is the first hook in a set of many, rewrites the target to jump to the hook past this one. Note that this
/// MAY also break leapfrog hooks, if this hook was installed as a branch but the next hook needs to be larger.
/// 3. If this is the last hook, makes the previous hook's orig point to the fixups directly, or to the no_fixups
/// function.
/// 4. If this is a hook in the middle, the hook before us's orig will point to the next hook's hook function.
/// After all that is done, the iterator is removed from the list of all hooks, and if empty, the entry from the targets
/// map is destroyed. Note that this invalidates all other held HookHandles to the SAME entry. Other entries will not be
/// invalidated.
